# Hamiltonian-Monte-Carlo-with-emulation
Data sets and Matlab software implementation for Hamiltonian and Lagrangian Monte Carlo algorithms coupled with emulation using Gaussian processes.
The zipped folder contains 4 examples, and for each example, a ReadMe file is provided.
This code acompanies the paper 'Emulation-accelerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in differential equation models' by L Mihaela Paun and Dirk Husmeier.
